title: Limits of Self Examination
---

Perception is biased by a multitude of factors, leaving our world tinted by subconscious thought patterns. The biases could be societal, personal, random, or any complex combination (i.e. stereotypes driven by personal and societal fear combined with biases imposed by your social media feed). It is not a single layer of tint. 

This block of imagery then gets filtered and compressed into a memory. Linear causal relationships, stories, and feelings are easier to compress into our brain. Biological pragmatism takes over here, affording us little choice over how we remember events. 

When we reflect on our actions, we are scanning through these compressed stories, unpacking them to form muddied imagery of scenes that likely did not occur in that way.  We see the action as something that happened to us, not as an impartial observer. 

One of the main goals of self-reflection is self-understanding, but we come up against limits: self-delusion, self-serving bias, or lack of awareness. We cannot simultaneously experience and self-reflect. Our pattern recognition abilities search for a narrative. Nevertheless it is still worth trying.
