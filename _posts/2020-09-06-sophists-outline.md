Aristotle taugh Alexander the Great after his father destroyed his home town. Our education system dismisses the opportunity to cultivate complete humans, with a philosophy of life, sound reasoning and rhetoric skills

- tracks toward corporate jobs 
- maintaining the status quo 
- does not teach quality (arete)
- math of the situation 
- puts the cost of the piece of paper at (Tuition - tutor)

**Hypothesis** - learning 1:1 with a tutor can cut down study time by 50% and improve retention.

**Experiment** - compare learning rate across difficult subjects. These subjects should range in familiarity to judge how well tutoring can fill in gaps in knowledge where these gaps are large.

**Difficulty** - N = 1 in this experiment and the results are hard to quantify. I should mock up some quizzes after finishing chapters then revisit them in 6 months to test retention of information.
