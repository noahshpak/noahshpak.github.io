title: Limits of Self Examination
---

When learning something complex and time-dependent (like solving algorithms for interviews) there is so much muscle memory that I find myself doubting my abilities once these techniques are not top-of-mind. 

This is a viscious cycle, causing me to believe that I never learned it or I did not learn it well enough. The framework of those thoughts is still there: be patient, focus hard, recall the topics (not the answer) that will allow me to reason my way to the answer.
